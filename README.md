# Surfs Up! - (sqlalchemy-challenge)

The present project contains two main files:

* __climate_starter.ipynb__ which performs some SQLAlchemy queries into a SQLite database for an exploratory analysis of the precipitation and temperature records over the Hawaian islands.

* __app.py__ which runs an app with Flask so any user can perform their own research into the database in a friendly manner.

Thanks!
